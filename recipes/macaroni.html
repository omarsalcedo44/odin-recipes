        <p>
            <em>Quick, easy, and tasty macaroni and cheese dish.</em>
            Fancy, designer mac and cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars to prepare when you have so many expensive cheeses, <strong>but</strong> they aren't always the best tasting. 
            This simple recipe is cheap <strong>and</strong> tasty.

        <h3 class="subheading">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul id="ingredients">

            <li class="items">1/4 cup of butter</li>
            <li class="items">1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li class="items">1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li class="items">ground black pepper to taste</li>

        </ul>
        <h3 class="subheading">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="steps"><strong>Boil Macaroni</strong></li>
            <p>Bring a pot of water to a boil. 
                Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong>For a thicker mac and cheese, double the amount of macaroni
            </p>
            <li class="steps"><strong>Make a Roux</strong></li>
            <p>While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux.
                A roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese.
            </p>
            <p>To make the roux, start by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
                Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. 
                Slowly pour in milk and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling.
                <strong>Be careful to not let the milk burn.</strong>
            </p>
            <li class="steps"><strong>Add Cheese and Macaroni</strong></li>
            <p>Finally, the most crucial step: <strong>Add cheese!</strong>
                Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted. 
                We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese.
            </p>
            <p>Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated.</p>
